Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIn this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.\n\n### Input:\nHematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop during embryogenesis in a complex process that involves multiple anatomical sites. Once HSC precursors have been specified from mesoderm, they have to mature into functional HSCs and undergo self-renewing divisions to generate a pool of HSCs. During this process, developing HSCs migrate through various embryonic niches, which provide signals for their establishment and the conservation of their self-renewal ability. These processes have to be recapitulated to generate HSCs from embryonic stem cells. Elucidating the interactions between developing HSCs and their niches should facilitate the generation and expansion of HSCs in vitro to exploit their clinical potential.\n\n### Response:\n"}

Under 100 words is a good title length.\n\n### Input:\nDespite intensive ongoing research, key aspects of the spatial-temporal evolution of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Great Britain (GB) remain unexplained. Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.\n\n### Response:\n"}

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.\n\n### Input:\nGraphs are a useful abstraction of image content. Not only can graphs represent details about individual objects in a scene but they can capture the interactions between pairs of objects. We present a method for training a convolutional neural network such that it takes in an input image and produces a full graph. This is done end-to-end in a single stage with the use of associative embeddings. The network learns to simultaneously identify all of the elements that make up a graph and piece them together.

While essential object detection ingredients such as features, classifiers, and proposal methods have been extensively researched surprisingly little work has aimed to systematically address NMS.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.\n\n### Input:\nAbstract: The excretion of four inhibitors of urinary stone formation (zinc, magnesium, citrates and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was studied in 20 normal controls and 40 recurrent calcium stone formers who were placed on a fixed diet restricted in calcium, oxalates and purines. We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.\n\n### Response:\n"}
