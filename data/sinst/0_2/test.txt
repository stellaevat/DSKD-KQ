Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true.

The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis. It makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis. It makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengths or weakens the hypothesis, respectively.<n><n>### Input:<n>Premise: PersonX starts to shake<n>Hypothesis: As a result, PersonX wants to calm down<n>Update: PersonX is on a roller coaster.<n><n>### Response:<n>

We have determined that by comparison with young subjects, the elderly controls have compromised although functionally effective balance. On the other hand, the balance response was severely compromised in half of the individuals with a history of falls. Experience with the Postural Stress Test suggests it will predict those elderly individuals with a tendency to fall as well as provide a simple mechanism for studying the balance response in the elderly. <n>Question Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Age Factors 3)Education, Premedical<n><n>### Response:<n>

Such keywords can be directly from the given abstract or outside it.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: Serum from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was tested by immunoblotting for reactivity against three muscle-derived preparations: denervated chick leg muscle extracts, media conditioned by denervated rat hemidiaphragms, and a human muscle extract. For each preparation, multiple bands were present using serum from all patients and controls, and no band was unique to ALS. Against rat muscle-conditioned medium, bands in the 56,000 (56K) molecular weight range were present to an equal degree in ALS and in controls; in addition, different bands near 56K were recognized by serum from different ALS patients. These results fail to confirm a recent report suggesting that anti-56K reactivity is characteristic of ALS.<n><n>### Response:<n>

The movements were accurate, and each segment of the geometric figures was performed with a roughly straight trajectory, but the time necessary to trace the geometric figures and the pauses at the vertices were prolonged. We conclude that in Parkinson's disease the disability in generating two joint ballistic movements depends on a difficulty in running motor programmes for complex trajectories. <n>Question Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Catecholamines 3)Cell Differentiation<n><n>### Response:<n>

You must determine whether or not the question is answerable from the given passage. If a question is answerable, output should be 'True', otherwise 'False'. You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False.<n><n>### Input:<n>Passage: For example, consider the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort. This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time O(n2) for this case. If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(n log n). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(n log n) time. Question: What does not solve the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input?<n><n>### Response:<n>
